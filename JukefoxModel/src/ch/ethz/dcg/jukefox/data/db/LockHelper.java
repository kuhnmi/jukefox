/**
 * This helper class supports the SqlDbDataPortal instances by synchronizing the accesses to the db. This is very useful
 * for SQLite databases, since they throw an error if two connections simultaneously try to write to the db (or some
 * other combinations). This helper holds such conflicting operations back (instead of throwing an exception) and
 * schedules them for later.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The SqlDbDataPortal is required to acquire a {@link LockType#SHARED}-lock whenever it tries to read from the
 * db-connection. Immediate transactions are required to acquire a {@link LockType#RESERVED}-lock and exclusive
 * transactions or write operations need to acquire a {@link LockType#EXCLUSIVE}-lock.<br/>
 * After the work is done, you need to release each lock. The order does not matter. Older locks kept locked until all
 * newer locks are released.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * If a transaction is started, locks kept locked until the transaction finishes (strict two-phase-locking).
