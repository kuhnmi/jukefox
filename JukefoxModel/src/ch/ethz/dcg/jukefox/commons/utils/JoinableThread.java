/**
 * Solves a bug in the Android 1.5 API (see https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6261). In particular,
 * join does not work correctly in Android 1.5, as it sometimes returns before the joined thread has finished execution.
 * Use this class instead of java.lang.Thread, and use the realJoin method to be sure that the joined thread has
 * finished execution.
