REMIND FOR ANDROID:

- Directory Blacklist File contains now the absolutePath... (incl. SDCARD_PATH), same as File Blacklist -> who is writing this file?
		Import reads it like this:
		OLD!!! dirNames.add(Constants.SDCARD_PATH + "/" + line);
		NEW!!! dirNames.add(line); 

- We need a "Main" with getContentProvider()
